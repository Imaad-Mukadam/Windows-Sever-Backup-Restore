# Windows-Sever-Backup-Restore

üñ•Ô∏è Windows Server System Backup and Restore ‚Äì Practical Summary
This project shows how to create a system backup of a Windows Server and how to restore it later when needed.

‚úÖ What I did:
Took a System Backup (includes system state and essential system files).

Used the Windows Server Backup tool to create the backup.

Saved the backup to a different drive or location.

Planned to restore the server's system using this backup (for recovery purposes).

üéØ Purpose:
To show how to protect the Windows Server system using backup and restore in case of failures or system issues.

## Steps 

1. In this screenshot, I created some users. Later, I will delete them and then restore the system to bring them back.

4.Now, click on Local Backup. You will see two options: Backup Schedule (used to configure daily backups) and Backup Once (used for a one-time manual backup). In this practical, I will perform a Backup Once operation.

14. Now that the backup is complete, we will delete the users we created earlier. After that, we will proceed with the restoration to recover them.

15. Now, open Windows Server Backup and click on Recover to begin the restoration process.

16. To recover the system backup, we must boot into Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM); otherwise, an error will occur during the restoration process.

üõ†Ô∏è What is DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode)?
DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode) is a special boot mode in Windows Server used for performing maintenance or recovery tasks related to Active Directory.

üîç Why is DSRM used?
It temporarily disables Active Directory so you can safely perform tasks like:

Restoring system state (e.g., from a backup)

Repairing or recovering Active Directory

Troubleshooting domain controller issues

17. To enter DSRM mode, press Windows + R, type msconfig, and press Enter.

18. Then, go to the Boot tab, check the Safe boot option, and select Active Directory repair. After that, click Apply, then OK.

19. Your system will now restart and boot into Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM).
